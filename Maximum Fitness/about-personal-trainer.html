            <h3>On being a qualified personal trainer</h3>
            <p>It was a huge boost knowing I was now qualified to put my training to the test
			with customers, but I still wasn’t completely satisfied. I knew there was more
			to learn out there.<br />
			That’s when I started self-experiments. Month after month I would trial
			new techniques and tweak some exercises, I didn’t want to be just another
			personal trainer that helps you get in to shape.<br />
			I wanted grunt, power, and conditioning, something that would make my
			clients stand out from the rest. It brought me back to my initial interest,
			athletes, sports, and challenges!</p>
			<p>SO I developed my program and training techniques whilst using myself as the
			guinea pig and then passed on the theories to the World’s Number 1 IBF
			Featherweight Champion, Billy The Kid Dib.<br />
			I was always a fan of Billy Dib, he is a born fighter, but like many professional
			sports athletes there is always an area that can be improved. For Billy, It was
			his need for greater strength and a killer knockout punch. I wanted to take his
			body condition to a place it’s never been before. After refining my “Train Like
			A Pro” program on Billy, I turned it into a professional program that anyone
			can use to take their strength and fitness to a new level.</p>
          </div>
          <div style="display: none;" id="tab2" class="tab_content">
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>Billy Dib’s dramatic conditioning reformation and phenomenal increase in
			strength and power, played a vital role in his 12 from 12 wins. My program
			along with great techniques Billy has developed over the years with Australia’s
			top boxing coach Billy Hussein, the kid was just destined for continuous
			knockouts.<br />
			But just don’t take my word for it, check out Billy the Kid’s video’s and
			testimonies!<br />
			<a href="testimonials.html" class="more">Billy the Kid’s video’s and
			testimonies &raquo;</a></p>

          <div style="display: none;" id="tab3" class="tab_content">
            <h3>Is my style of training and program suitable for everyone?</h3>
            <p>In my opinion, Strength training and conditioning is a necessity to the majority
			of society. The daily struggles and challenges we face in our lives, from poor
			diet, lack of exercises, fatigue and lack of sleep, it all plays an impact. How
			many times have you heard this from your friends’ “he or she is so skinny,
			there so lucky and fit “ ! It’s not always the case!
			To ensure a long and healthy life, we need to start with our inner strength and
			ability to keep up with our busy schedules.</p>
			<p>Kids:<br />
			Often I receive enquiries from parents asking me to train their kids to improve
			their fitness levels so coincide with their sports.<br />
			For example: Kids playing tennis, soccer, football etc., all need to increase their
			strength and agility to perform at their best.<br />
			Whether you’re an amateur, professional athlete or just someone who wants
			the best results with their fitness training, Maximum Fitness is the place to be.</p>
