            <p>Making the choice to train with Haitham from Maximum Fitness was easy. The
				training however has been hard. This doesn’t matter though because through this
				hard training regime and Haitham’s motivational skills I feel I have acquired many
				attributes which are needed in order for a boxer to succeed. These attributes include
				unbelievable power, increased stamina and vastly improved core body strength. This
				has been especially evident in last 6 fights in which I’ve scored 6 wins all by the way
				of knockout. My only regret since training with Haitham is that I didn’t look for his
				help earlier.<br />

            <p>Hi, my name is Billy Hussein,
			I am a professional boxing trainer, currently training “Billy the Kid” for his world
			title shot and as part of my boxing program I use the best resources available to me
			to take my boxers to the next level. Boxing is a science, and I need tacticians and
			professionals to push my fighter’s bodies and minds to levels they did not know
			where possible.

			Haitham Arifaki has been an intricate part of my complete training schedule. Haitham
			takes my fighters bodies and minds to their strength and conditioning levels that put
			them above the rest.

			I have witnessed Haitham’s training techniques first hand with Billy Dib. After much
			scrutiny and analysis I can with clear conscious say that Haitham has contributed to
			Billy’s massive improvement in power and strength.

			Clearly and with no doubt Haitham is a results driven trainer. He is consistently
			attentive, always focused on the goal, always focused on the client. I would
			recommend Haitham and go further to say that he should be a part of any professional
			training team; he will add success for sure.</p>

            <p>"Haitham is a real joy to work with and brings an enthusiasm with him that makes working
			out fun. He always gives me a variety of exercises that makes what used to be a boring
			process actually stimulating and enjoyable and challenging.

			He always explain to me how an exercise is working for me, and explains the process in
			simple terms so I can concentrate on how to perform it without being confused or hurt
			myself. Haitham has an engaging personality that makes you want to work hard and push
			yourself past what you thought you could do not only is he my Personal Trainer but my
			Mentor as well. Of course, it is hard work, but Haitham makes you want to achieve your
			Maximum goals through constant encouragement and tips.

			I have seen results in a short period of time and for the first time in a very long time I can
			see my goals as something I can realistically achieve and which I have. He has a wonderful
			personality and always brings a smile with him. I never feel rushed with him and he makes
			me feel as if I am his priority every goal I achieve is a win for him as well which makes us a
			force to be reckoned with.

			He is organized and moves the sessions along at a good pace without having to pause and
			think of what to do next. I feel as though Haitham has thought and planned the workout for
			me each time I am with him.

			I would not hesitate to recommend Haitham to anyone looking to start a program or gain
			more knowledge as to what they are doing. The only thing I regret is not calling Haitham
			sooner!"<br />

            <p>Hi	Haitham	
			I	wanted	to	thank	you	for	training	me	for	the	last	7	months.
			I	had	been	circuit	and	weight	training	for	the	last	15	years	and	I	considered	
			myself	to	be	pretty	fit……..until	I	met	you.
			You	are	the	best	personal	trainer	I	have	worked	with.
			Your	workouts	are	always	challenging	and	you	have	pushed	me	physically	and	
			mentally	to	limits	I	never	thought	I	could	achieve.
			The	variety	and	intensity	of	the	workouts	has	given	me	a	renewed	enthusiasm	to	
			train	harder	and	help	me	reach	my	full	fitness	potential.
			I	also	like	the	fact	that	you	are	well	organized	and	professional,	you	keep	records	
			of	our	workouts	and	revisit	them	weeks	later	to		monitor		my	progress.
			I	am	constantly	asked	about	the	training	I	do	and	I	always	have	no	hesitation	
			passing	on	your	details	and	recommending	you	to	others
			Thanks	again	and	I	look	forward	to	continuing	training	with	you	to	achieve

            <p>After returning to Australia from a 7 year stint in Hong Kong I needed something to get me
				motivated into exercise again.
				I found Haitham from Maximum Fitness and haven’t looked back since.
				I’m 58 years old and he pushes me to my limits but understands my boundaries therefore still
				getting the best results.
				His trainings are never dull and boring and his professionalism and knowledge is of the highest
				standard.
				I highly recommend anyone serious about results to give Haitham a call.<br />

            <p>I decided to go to Haitham at Maximum Fitness to lose the baby weight after having my second child.
			He varies the trainings so you can’t get bored, he keeps them fun but also manages to push you to
			your limits getting maximum results.
			I have dropped 5 dress sizes in 3 months and am now back wearing all the clothes I was wearing
			prior to falling pregnant and could not be happier.
			Anyone contemplating personal training would be crazy not to use him.<br />

            <p>"I hired Haitham Arifaki from Maximum Fitness to help me with my son’s weight. Not only did Haitham incorporate eating habits and healthy living into my sons overall well being but he also overwhelmed me with his vast knowledge and flexibility in training methods he implemented in all workouts. My sons drive and stamina escalated and in turn so did his confidents levels. I could not believe his progress in his physical strength and endurance in a very short period of time. From a child who could not scrap up a jog to a runner.<br />
			Haitham dedicated not only his time but his emotions with every session. When my son was struggling Haithams encouraging words of belief pushed him to levels I thought were not possible.<br />
			He then went a step further and created a boot camp for us. He was so accommodating and very respectful in his positive approach to training which has been nothing short of awesome for not only my son but us as a family.<br />
			He was our motivator our mentor and our strength never hesitating to flick an email with little suggestions and check on our day to day well being.<br />
			I honestly believe if it wasn’t for Haitham my son would not be the confident little footballer he is today.”</p>

            <p>My First thoughts of this plan was it was just another fitness program you can buy online
			which has results that are reachable only by EXTREME workouts and DEDICATION... I
			was wrong!<br />

			Being 21, you always want to look your best!.. For years I was overweight and it got to
			a point where i thought.... I deserve to be fit and I deserve to have a body which i am
			comfortable with! , and Maximum Fitness defiantly helped me develop this!<br /><br />

			THE FAST RESULTS FROM THIS PROGRAM IS JUST THE BEGINNING !</p>

            <p>My Name is Simone Berry I have been training with Haitham now for 10 months. I have tried several other fitness centres and programs but none seem to be able to compare with the training program
			Haitham has personally designed for me.
			For the first time in my life I enjoy exercise and love how I feel after each session. When I first
			started I could not run at all, Not even for 2 minutes. Haitham has been so patient with me,
			understanding, professional and helpful in maintaining my enthusiasm and drive to train and lose
			weight and achieve a fitness level I never thought possible.
			I love that my sessions are one on one and customised to my fitness level and my time schedule as
			I am a mum and also work, I sometimes don't have the energy or time to fit in exercise but Haitham
			always seems to motivate me and has actually changed my whole attitude to exercise to the point I
			actually like going and want to train more and more. I also like that friends and family have notice
			I've lost weight and my body shape has changed.
			I recommend anyone to train with Haitham, he is one of the nicest people I know and if he can
			motivate me, he can motivate anyone.<br />
